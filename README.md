# Family Clinic Dashboard

A clinic dashboard built with Next.js and Supabase to help clinic staff manage patients and appointments.

## Chart One: New Patients per Month

- **Question:** Is the practice growing? How many new patients joined each month?
- **Who acts:** The clinic owner decides whether to open a second consulting day.
- **Chart shape:** Bar chart, one bar per month, covering the last six months.
- **Database view:** `public.patients_per_month`
- **View columns:** `month_start`, `label`, `new_patients`
- **Security:** The view uses `security_invoker = true` so queries respect the signed-in user's access policies on the underlying `patients` table.

### Data preparation

- The `patients` table is protected by Row Level Security (RLS).
- Test patient records are seeded across the six-month period.
- The `patients_per_month` view returns six monthly rows, including months with zero new patients.
- The view has been tested through the app using two separate user accounts.

### Technology

- Next.js
- Supabase
- PostgreSQL

## Development

Run the application from the `nextjs-dashboard` directory using the project's package scripts.

```bash
npm run dev
```

The development server normally runs at `http://localhost:3000`.
